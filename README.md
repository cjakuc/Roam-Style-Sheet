Guide to using a custom style sheet with Roam [here](https://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam)

Basic instructions:
- Download the [Stylus extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) for Chrome
- Open the extension, create a new style, and copy and paste the contents of cjakuc_nightowl into it
- Set the URL at the bottom to only be https://roamresearch.com/ or the specific Roam page you want to stylize
